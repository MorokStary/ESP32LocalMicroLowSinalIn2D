# ESP32LocalMicroLowSinalIn2D
The system consists of a microphone array connected to an ESP32.

## Simulation Module
`sim_module.py` emulates the ESP32 output while hardware is unavailable. The script
creates weak sinusoidal signals, adds synthetic white and pink noise according
to a chosen SNR, quantizes the result to `float32` and publishes packets over
MQTT using a MessagePack payload. The default topic is `USTYM/LPNU`.

A realâ€‘time mode can be enabled with `--realtime` which transmits data at twice
the normal sampling rate for faster algorithm testing.

## Calibration Suite
`calibration_suite.py` generates multichannel test signals using synthetic room impulse responses produced by [Pyroomacoustics](https://github.com/LCAV/pyroomacoustics). The script sends packets to an MQTT broker with the true source coordinates and varying tone amplitudes. This data can be collected by `HostCollector` to evaluate localization accuracy and tune classification thresholds.
