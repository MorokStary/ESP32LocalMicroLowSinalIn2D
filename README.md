# ESP32LocalMicroLowSinalIn2D
The system consists of a microphone array connected to an ESP32.

## Simulation Module
`sim_module.py` emulates the ESP32 output while hardware is unavailable. The script
creates weak sinusoidal signals, adds synthetic white and pink noise according
to a chosen SNR, quantizes the result to `float32` and publishes packets over
MQTT using a MessagePack payload. The default broker is the public HiveMQ instance
`broker.mqttdashboard.com` and the default topic is `USTYM/LPNU`.

A realâ€‘time mode can be enabled with `--realtime` which transmits data at twice
the normal sampling rate for faster algorithm testing.

## Calibration Suite
`calibration_suite.py` generates multichannel test signals using synthetic room impulse responses produced by [Pyroomacoustics](https://github.com/LCAV/pyroomacoustics). The script sends packets to an MQTT broker with the true source coordinates and varying tone amplitudes. This data can be collected by `HostCollector` to evaluate localization accuracy and tune classification thresholds.
 
## Web Interface
`web_interface.py` launches a small Flask application that streams randomized coordinates over SocketIO. These values are visualized in the browser as a heatmap and a detection timeline using Plotly. The dashboard page includes simple styling for a cleaner layout.

## Data Storage
`data_storage.py` implements asynchronous writes to a SQLite database. Event samples and filter parameters are kept in separate tables indexed by timestamp for quick statistical queries.

## Setup

1. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running

- **Signal simulator**:
  ```bash
  python sim_module.py --host broker.mqttdashboard.com --port 1883 --topic USTYM/LPNU
  ```
  Add `--realtime` to double the output speed.

- **Calibration suite**:
  ```bash
  python calibration_suite.py --host broker.mqttdashboard.com --port 1883 --topic USTYM/CALIB
  ```

- **Web interface**:
  ```bash
  python web_interface.py
  ```
  Then open `http://localhost:5000/` in a browser.
