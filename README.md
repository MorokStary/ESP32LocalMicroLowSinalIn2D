# ESP32LocalMicroLowSinalIn2D
The system consists of a microphone array connected to an ESP32.

## Simulation Module
`sim_module.py` emulates the ESP32 output while hardware is unavailable. The script
creates weak sinusoidal signals, adds synthetic white and pink noise according
to a chosen SNR, quantizes the result to `float32` and publishes packets over
MQTT using a MessagePack payload. The default topic is `USTYM/LPNU`.

A realâ€‘time mode can be enabled with `--realtime` which transmits data at twice
the normal sampling rate for faster algorithm testing.

## Calibration Suite
`calibration_suite.py` generates multichannel test signals using synthetic room impulse responses produced by [Pyroomacoustics](https://github.com/LCAV/pyroomacoustics). The script sends packets to an MQTT broker with the true source coordinates and varying tone amplitudes. This data can be collected by `HostCollector` to evaluate localization accuracy and tune classification thresholds.
 
## Web Interface
`web_interface.py` launches a small Flask application secured with JWT tokens. After logging in at `/login`, the browser connects via SocketIO and receives randomized coordinates which are visualized as a heatmap and detection timeline using Plotly.

## Data Storage
`data_storage.py` implements asynchronous writes to a SQLite database. Event samples and filter parameters are kept in separate tables indexed by timestamp for quick statistical queries.
